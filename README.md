As part of my propaedeutic certificate, we were instructed to assemble a team and develop a creative and efficient solution that aims to ease the organization of festivals for a client. The solution was separated in two parts a website and a desktop application.

My role in our team was a Project Leader and a Front-End developer, additionally I took a fair share of the Back-End work on the website. My knowledge took the websiteâ€™s user experience and material design look very far. 

Thanks to the opportunity I developed a deeper understanding of teamwork and it's dynamics. Another key learning moment was scheduling regular meetings with the client and discussing the results so far. Finally, the project helped me improve my web development skills with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP even further.
